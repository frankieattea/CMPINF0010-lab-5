We chose to have our license to allow people to edit freely our code, because we only have a small program running so we want people to feel free to expand upon the work produced.  This license allows people to do many different things with this code which we believe is necessary for the project we produced.  We want people to not feel too restricted with our license and use our code as they see fit.
